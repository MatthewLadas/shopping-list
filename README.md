# shopping-list

This project aims to practice what I’ve recently learned in JavaScript. I’ll be adding HTML and CSS starter files as the project’s goal is to focus solely on JS.

I’ll be using this Shopping List to re-enforce my knowledge on Custom Events, Event Delegation, Local Storage, DOM Events, Object Reference.
